# Special Offer for participating Indie Developers!

## Glassfy - https://glassfy.io

Glassfy was built by Indie Devs. After building apps for a long time they realised there wasn’t a tool for end to end App Revenue Management - so they built a tool for that - everything from Subscription Management to Real-time Analytics and Paywalls all in one tool, helping boost app revenue 30%+.

All Apps participating in this years Indie Apps Sale will receive 50% off of using Glassfy for their first year. Simply notify Glassfy via their website support chat and tell them you’re an Indie Apps Sale participant and they will apply it to your account.

Thank you so much, Glassfy!
